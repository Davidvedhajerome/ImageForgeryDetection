## 2. Features

Our Image Forgery Detection Software is designed to offer the following key features:

- **Forgery Detection**: The software detects common image manipulation techniques such as copy-paste, splicing, and other forms of manipulation.
- **Multi-Format Support**: It can analyze images in various formats, including JPEG, PNG, and more.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: The software provides an intuitive command-line interface for running the detection algorithms.
- **Python and MATLAB Integration**: We've harnessed the capabilities of both Python and MATLAB to create a robust image analysis platform that combines their strengths.

## 3. Prerequisites

To run the software effectively, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed on your system:

- **Python**: Install Python 3.6 or higher. You can download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

- **MATLAB**: The software requires MATLAB R2017b or a newer version. You can acquire MATLAB from [MathWorks](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html).

- **Python Packages**: Install the following Python packages using `pip`:

  - NumPy
  - OpenCV
  - Pillow (Python Imaging Library)

- **MATLAB Image Processing Toolbox**: Ensure you have the Image Processing Toolbox installed in MATLAB.

## 4. Installation

Follow these steps to install the software:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/teammates/image-forgery-detection.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd image-forgery-detection
   ```

3. Ensure that you have all the prerequisites mentioned in the [Prerequisites](#prerequisites) section.

## 5. Usage

Using our Image Forgery Detection Software is straightforward:

1. Open a command-line terminal or shell.

2. Navigate to the project directory where the software is located.

3. Run the forgery detection script using the following command:

   ```bash
   python forgery_detection.py input_image.jpg
   ```

   Replace `input_image.jpg` with the path to the image you want to analyze.

4. The software will process the image and display the results, indicating whether any forgery was detected.
